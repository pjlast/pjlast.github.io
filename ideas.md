Just random thoughts/ideas.

## Ideas

- Blog post: always build an escape hatch
  - In the initial Cody prototype we wanted everything to be magic and "Just Work" as Todd Howard would say.
    One thing we did right was to make context visible. But there was no way to manually edit/tweak the context.
    So if the search/context fetchers fucked up a bit, tough shit. This was clearly a mistake.

## Thoughts

- Some people are addicted to suffering. There always needs to be some form of hardship, even if it's self-inflicted.
- People don't have your best interest at heart.
- Don't put too much weight on the opinions of people online. I think there's a phenomenon where we
  see people online as this one giant individual, instead of a bunch of smaller individuals,
  and we start trusting "their" opinions on things like politics because "they" made a really good point on
  a programming topic that we did actually know something about. Just remember, these people
  thought Arcane season 2 was a failure, they're consistently wrong about election outcomes,
  they spew as much hatred as the people they're angry at for spewing hatred.
- You don't know when you're in an echo chamber.
- Maybe everyone isn't stupid. Maybe you're just smart.
  - The distinction here is that feeling like everyone around you is stupid can
    be quite depressing and demotivating. Whereas, if you're just smart, you're
    empowered and you can make a difference.
